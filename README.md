### Talk 1
Most Bot and Assistant projects never reach the real world. There's a lot of PoC's started, but few actually make it. In this talk you'll learn the secrets to launch omnichannel bots and assistants and learn about the framework to build, roll-out and scale them in the real world. We'll walk you through: - How to build a stellar bot experience with a new Twilio product — Autopilot.

### Talk 2
Learn more advance chatbot features on Watson Assistant like digressions, handlers, context management and how to enhance your bot using Serverless middleware and IBM Cognitive Services.
